      <h1>How startups evolve ?</h1>

<time datetime="2022-12-07">07 Dec 2022</time>
<a href="/tags/startup/" class="post-tag">startup</a>

<p>There is a lot of startup buzz these days. Technology is the reason for this buzz and its also the reason why today so many tech entreprenueres are able to build companies from scratch and take them to million or billion dollar valuations. We are very fortunate to live in a world full of opportunities. This was beyond reach even for our last generation human beings.</p>
<p>So this post is about how a tech startups evolve. This will give a map on how startups are born and what stages a company goes through, what skill sets required for founders/leadership in each of these stages etc.</p>
<h1 id="evolution" tabindex="-1">Evolution <a class="direct-link" href="#evolution" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1>
<p>Startup is born when one or more individuals (will be called as founders hereafter) have a burning desire to solve a problem or provide a service to the market.</p>
<p>Once the problem and initial founding members are identified the journey of a company kicks off.</p>
<p>Generally startups goes through 3 stages before becoming a big company. <strong>0-1 stage, 1-10 stage and 10-100</strong> stage based on the revenue. Startups should follow different operating models and founders need to posess different skill sets in operating each of these stages.</p>
<h2 id="0-1-stage" tabindex="-1">0-1 Stage <a class="direct-link" href="#0-1-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Its the timeline between just a startup idea to 500K - 1M ARR. Priority at this stage of a company should be to get the product out as soon as possible so that customers are ready to use and pay for it.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-founder" tabindex="-1">Role of the founder <a class="direct-link" href="#role-of-the-founder" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Find the right team (of 1-2 person) who are passionate to work on the idea.</li>
<li>Speed of execution (atleast one major release a week).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme-of-the-company-at-this-stage" tabindex="-1">Theme of the company at this stage <a class="direct-link" href="#theme-of-the-company-at-this-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Speed trumps everything. No place for optimization or scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>In recent times, i read few articles where companies are successful without going through this 0-1 stage of getting quick MVP (minimum viable product) and iterate. Figma is an example where the founders started their work on 2012 and the first public beta was released on 2015. For 3 full years, the founders were working on Figma's first beta launch and still Figma was able to run successful company and exit.</p>
<p><strong>My take</strong></p>
<p>0-1 stage of a startup is all about fighting for survival. The only possible way a startup fail at this stage is by running out of cash. Even the product ideas are bound to pivot. So  startups should focus on getting the cash to survive either by convincing the customers or find a investor to get a longer runway. (In case of Figma, Dylan Field - CEO and Founder of Figma is a Theil Fellow who got 3.8M $ in 2013 just in one year after starting the company).</p>
<h2 id="1-10-stage" tabindex="-1">1-10 Stage <a class="direct-link" href="#1-10-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Its the timeline between your first paying customer (or first investor) to building a sizeable customer base to consistently get a revenue of 500K to 10M ARR. This stage is all about growth &amp; scale so that new customers can easily oboard easily and existing customers can use your product at ease.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-founder-1" tabindex="-1">Role of the founder <a class="direct-link" href="#role-of-the-founder-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Create processes to run day to day operations.</li>
<li>Hiring the right people - This is the most important aspect and determines further success. Founders should look for people having skills or potential and passionate about solving problem for the company.</li>
<li>Update the product to handle scale (wrt to different customer requirements). Also focus a bit on optimization as well.</li>
<li>Setup the culture by defining what the company stands for.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme-for-the-company" tabindex="-1">Theme for the company <a class="direct-link" href="#theme-for-the-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Growth and Increase the length of runway.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the team is onboarded and the flywheel starts in the positive direction, founders should slowly shift thier focus from day to day operations to long term strategies like brand building, community building, product positioning so that the startup is ready to take the next stage.</p>
<p>This part of the startup life is called <strong>Scale &amp; Grow</strong></p>
<h2 id="10-100-stage" tabindex="-1">10-100 Stage <a class="direct-link" href="#10-100-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This the timeline between 10M to 100M ARR where the company will be competing against the big boys for fat contracts. At this stage, startup should look to provide competitive offering so that company's name should be considered as a verb (like google for search, slack for chat etc).</p>
<p>At this stage, startups should consider expanding horizontally by offering more products which aligns with the vision.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-founders" tabindex="-1">Role of the founders <a class="direct-link" href="#role-of-the-founders" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Strategy for long term (3-5 yrs) and encourage the leadership to think long term.</li>
<li>Setup the leadership team with broad responsibilities and goals.</li>
<li>Evangelize the product by conducting conferences, events, talks etc.</li>
<li>Slowly move away from day to day operations but should be willing to get to the details as on when required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme-for-the-company-1" tabindex="-1">Theme for the company <a class="direct-link" href="#theme-for-the-company-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Build high quality product.</li>
<li>Optimize cost</li>
<li>Raise the overall bar and set standards for others to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This part of the startup life is called <strong>Showcase</strong></p>
<p>Lot of great content is available in the internet which talks about how companies handled these stages in detail. Further reading pointers about startups and startup evolution can be from these links below -</p>

<p><em>NOTE: I am no startup expert. I didnt start or ran a successful startup company. The above post is just my observation so far while closely following the tech startup scene. As mentioned in the about section page, the posts in this site are just reflection of my thoughts which i believe will help me in providing more clarity. So take it a grain of salt.</em></p>
