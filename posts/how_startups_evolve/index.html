      <h1>How startups evolve ?</h1>

<time datetime="2022-12-07">07 Dec 2022</time>
<a href="/tags/startup/" class="post-tag">startup</a>

<p>There is a lot of startup buzz these days. Technology is the main reason for this buzz and its the reason why today so many tech entreprenueres are able to build companies from scratch and take them to million / billion dollar valuations. We are fortunate to live in a world full of opportunities. This was beyond reach even for the last generation humans.</p>
<p>Objective of this post is to talk about how tech statups evolve and grow, what skill sets required for founders &amp; leaders in every stage of the company.</p>
<h1 id="evolution" tabindex="-1">Evolution <a class="direct-link" href="#evolution" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1>
<p>A startup is born when one or more individuals have a burning desire to solve a problem or provide a service to the market. Once the problem and founding members are identified, the journey of our company starts.</p>
<p>Generally startups goes through 3 stages. <strong>0-1 stage, 1-10 stage and 10-100</strong>. Each startup follows different operating models in these stages and founders needs different skill sets in operating the company on each of these stages.</p>
<h2 id="0-1-stage" tabindex="-1">0-1 Stage <a class="direct-link" href="#0-1-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Its the timeline between just a startup idea to 500K - 1M ARR. Priority at this stage of a company should be to get the product out as soon as possible so that customers are ready to use and pay for it. This is the pre PFM (Product Market Fit) stage.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-founder" tabindex="-1">Role of the founder <a class="direct-link" href="#role-of-the-founder" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Find the right team (of ~10 people) who are passionate to work on the idea.</li>
<li>Speed of execution (atleast one major release a week).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme-of-the-company-at-this-stage" tabindex="-1">Theme of the company at this stage <a class="direct-link" href="#theme-of-the-company-at-this-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Speed trumps everything. No place for optimization or scale. Just ship as many features as possible so that your customers cuts you checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In recent times, i read few articles where companies are successful without going through this 0-1 stage of getting quick MVP (minimum viable product) and iterate. Figma is an example where the founders started their work on 2012 and the first public beta was released on 2015. For 3 full years, the founders were working on Figma's first beta launch and still Figma was able to run successful company and exit.</p>
<p><strong>My take</strong></p>
<p>0-1 stage of a startup is all about fighting for survival. The only possible way a startup fail at this stage is by running out of cash. Product is bound to pivot. So startups should focus on getting the cash to survive either by sellling the product to customers or find a investor to get a longer runway. (In case of Figma, Dylan Field - CEO and Founder of Figma is a Theil Fellow who got 3.8M $ in 2013 just in one year after starting the company).</p>
<h2 id="1-10-stage" tabindex="-1">1-10 Stage <a class="direct-link" href="#1-10-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Its the timeline between your first paying customer (or first investor) to building a sizeable customer base to consistently get a revenue of 500K to 10M ARR. This stage is all about growth &amp; scale so that new customers can easily oboard easily and existing customers can use your product at ease.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-founder-1" tabindex="-1">Role of the founder <a class="direct-link" href="#role-of-the-founder-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Create processes to run day to day operations.</li>
<li>Hiring the right people - This is the most important aspect and determines further success. Founders should look for people having skills or potential and passionate about solving problem for the company.</li>
<li>Update the product to handle scale (wrt to different customer requirements). Also focus a bit on optimization as well.</li>
<li>Setup the culture by defining what the company stands for.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme-for-the-company" tabindex="-1">Theme for the company <a class="direct-link" href="#theme-for-the-company" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Growth and Increase the length of runway.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the team is onboarded and the flywheel starts in the positive direction, founders should slowly shift thier focus from day to day operations to medium term strategies like brand building, community building, product positioning so that the startup is ready to take the next stage.</p>
<p>This part of the startup life can be referred as <strong>Scale &amp; Grow</strong></p>
<h2 id="10-100-stage" tabindex="-1">10-100 Stage <a class="direct-link" href="#10-100-stage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>This the timeline between 10M to 100M ARR where the company will be competing against the big boys for fat contracts. At this stage, startup should look to provide competitive offering so that company's name should be considered as a verb (like google for search, slack for chat etc) in their respective domain.</p>
<p>At this stage, startups should consider expanding horizontally by offering more products and features and broaden their total adressable market size.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-the-founders" tabindex="-1">Role of the founders <a class="direct-link" href="#role-of-the-founders" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Strategy for long term (3-5 yrs) and encourage the leadership to think long term.</li>
<li>Setup the leadership team with broad responsibilities and goals.</li>
<li>Evangelize the product by conducting conferences, events, talks etc.</li>
<li>Completely move away from day to day operations but should be willing to get to the details and fire-fighting as on when required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="theme-for-the-company-1" tabindex="-1">Theme for the company <a class="direct-link" href="#theme-for-the-company-1" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Build high quality product.</li>
<li>Optimize cost</li>
<li>Raise the overall bar and set standards for others to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This part of the startup life is called <strong>Showcase</strong></p>
<p>Lot of great content is available in the internet which talks about how companies handled these stages in detail. Further reading pointers about startups and startup evolution can be from these links below -</p>

<p><em>NOTE: I am no startup expert. I didnt start or ran a successful startup company. The above post is just my observation so far while closely following the tech startup scene. As mentioned in my about section page, the posts in this site are just reflection of my thoughts which i believe will help me in providing more clarity to my thoughts. So take it with a pinch of salt.</em></p>
